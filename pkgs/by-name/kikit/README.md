## Dependencies

### Shapely

KiKit depends on an outdated version of Shapely, see
<https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit/issues/574>.

The files in `/pkgs/kikit/shapely` were copied from [nixpkgs at revision `8d8e62e`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/8d8e62e74f511160a599471549a98bc9e4f4818d) and slightly adapted and reformatted.
